Illustrated.ml has demos about machine learning and statistical algorithms and concepts. The aim is to help users develop an intuitive understanding of various concepts by letting them play with various parameters and see the results in real time. 

The primary frameworks being used are [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) and [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/).

This project was supported in part by Department of [Statistical Learning and Data Science](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/) at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
